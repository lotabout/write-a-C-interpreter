Normally we represent the token as a pair: `(token type, token value)`.
For example, if a program's source file contains the string "998", the lexer
will treat it as token `(Number, 998)`, meaning it's a number with value `998`.


## Lexer vs Compiler

Let's first look at the structure of a compiler:

```
                   +-------+                      +--------+
-- source code --> | lexer | --> token stream --> | parser | --> assembly
                   +-------+                      +--------+
```

The compiler can be treated as a transformer that transform C source code into
Assembly. In this sense, both lexer and parser are transformers as well: the
lexer takes C source code as input and outputs a token stream; the parser will
consume the token stream and generate Assembly code.

Then why do we need lexer and a parser? Well the compiler's job is hard! So we
recruit the lexer to do part of the job, and the parser to do the rest of it,
so that each will only need to deal with a single and simple job.

That's the value of a lexer: to simplify the parser by converting the stream
of source code into a stream of tokens.


## Implementation Choice

Before we start I want to let you know that crafting a lexer is boring and
error-prone. That's why geniuses out there have already created automation
tools to do the job. Tools like `lex/flex` allow us to describe the lexical
rules using regular expressions and then generate a lexer for us.

Also note that we won't follow the graph shown in the previous section, i.e.
we won't be converting all the source code into a token stream at once. The
reasons being:

1. Converting source code into token stream is stateful.
   How a string is interpreted depends on the context where it appears.
2. storing all the tokens is a waste, because only a few of them will be
   accessed at any given time.

Thus we'll implement the `next()` function, which returns one token per call.


## Supported Tokens

Add the definition into the global area:

```c
// tokens and classes (operators last and in precedence order)
enum {
  Num = 128, Fun, Sys, Glo, Loc, Id,
  Char, Else, Enum, If, Int, Return, Sizeof, While,
  Assign, Cond, Lor, Lan, Or, Xor, And, Eq, Ne, Lt, Gt, Le, Ge, Shl, Shr, Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Mod, Inc, Dec, Brak
};
```

These are all the tokens our lexer can understand. Our lexer will interpret the
string `=` as token `Assign`; `==` as token `Eq`; `!=` as `Ne`; etc.

So we have the impression that a token will contain one or more characters.
This is the reason why the lexer can reduce complexity, now the parser doesn't
have to look at several character to identify the meaning of a substring â€” this
job has already be taken care of.

Of course, the tokens above are properly ordered reflecting their priority in
the C programming language. The `*(Mul)` operator, for example, has higher
priority than the `+(Add)` operator. We'll talk more about this later.

Finally, there are some characters we didn't include here, although they are
tokens themselves, such as `]` or `~`. The reason why we're not encoding them
like the others are:

1. These tokens consist of just a single character, therefore they're easier
   to identify.
2. They are not involved into the priority battle.


## Skeleton of Lexer

```c
void next() {
    char *last_pos;
    int hash;
    while (token = *src) {
        ++src;
        // parse token here
    }
    return;
}
```

Why do we need a `while` here, knowing that `next()` will only parse one token?
This raises a question in compiler construction (remember that lexer is kind of
compiler?): How to handle errors?

Normally we have two solutions:

1. Point out where the error occurred, and quit.
2. Point out where the error occurred, skip it, and continue.

These explains the presence of `while`: to skip unknown characters in the
source code. Meanwhile, it's used to skip whitespace, which is not actually
part of a program. They are treated as separators only.


## Newline

A newline is similar to whitespace, because we're' skipping it. The only
difference is that we need to increase the line number whenever a newline
character is encountered:

```c
// parse token here
...
if (token == '\n') {
    ++line;
}
...
```

## Macros

Macros in C start with character `#`, e.g. `#include <stdio.h>`.
Our compiler doesn't support any macros, so we'll skip all of them:

```c
else if (token == '#') {
    // skip macro, because we will not support it
    while (*src != 0 && *src != '\n') {
        src++;
    }
}
```


## Identifiers and Symbol Table

An identifier is the name of a variable. But we don't actually care about the
names in lexer, we care about the identity. For example: `int a;` declares a
variable, we have to know that the statement `a = 10` that comes after refers
to the same variable that we declared before.

Based on this reason, we'll make a table to store all the names we've already
met and call it Symbol Table. We'll look up the table whenever a new
name/identifier is encountered. If the name exists in the symbol table, its
identity is returned.

Then, how do we represent an identity?

```c
struct identifier {
    int token;
    int hash;
    char * name;
    int class;
    int type;
    int value;
    int Bclass;
    int Btype;
    int Bvalue;
}
```

We'll need a little explanation here:

1. `token`: is the token type of an identifier.
   Theoretically it should be fixed to type `Id`. But it is not true because we
   will add keywords (e.g `if`, `while`) as special kinds of identifier.
2. `hash`: the hash value of the identifier's name, to speed up comparisons
   during table lookup operations.
3. `name`: well, the identifier's name.
4. `class`: Whether the identifier is global, local or constant.
5. `type`: type of the identifier, `int`, `char` or pointer.
6. `value`: the value of the variable that the identifier points to.
7. `BXXX`: local variables can [shadow] global variables.
   It's used to store global ones, if that happens.

A traditional symbol table will contain only the unique identifier, whereas our
symbol table stores other information that will only be accessed by the parser,
such as `type`.

Yet sadly, our compiler won't support `struct` while we are trying to bootstrap
it. So we have to compromise in the actual structure of an identifier:

```
Symbol table:
----+-----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+------+------+----
 .. |token|hash|name|type|class|value|btype|bclass|bvalue| ..
----+-----+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+------+------+----
    |<---       one single identifier                --->|
```

This means we use a single `int` array to store all identifier information.
Each ID will use 9 cells. The code is as follows:

```c
int token_val;                // value of current token (mainly for number)
int *current_id,              // current parsed ID
    *symbols;                 // symbol table
// fields of identifier
enum {Token, Hash, Name, Type, Class, Value, BType, BClass, BValue, IdSize};
void next() {
        ...
        else if ((token >= 'a' && token <= 'z') || (token >= 'A' && token <= 'Z') || (token == '_')) {
            // parse identifier
            last_pos = src - 1;
            hash = token;
            while ((*src >= 'a' && *src <= 'z') || (*src >= 'A' && *src <= 'Z') || (*src >= '0' && *src <= '9') || (*src == '_')) {
                hash = hash * 147 + *src;
                src++;
            }
            // look for existing identifier, linear search
            current_id = symbols;
            while (current_id[Token]) {
                if (current_id[Hash] == hash && !memcmp((char *)current_id[Name], last_pos, src - last_pos)) {
                    //found one, return
                    token = current_id[Token];
                    return;
                }
                current_id = current_id + IdSize;
            }
            // store new ID
            current_id[Name] = (int)last_pos;
            current_id[Hash] = hash;
            token = current_id[Token] = Id;
            return;
        }
        ...
}
```

Note that the search in the symbol table is a linear search.


## Number

We need to support decimal, hexadecimal and octal. The logic is quite
straightforward, except how to get the hexadecimal value. Maybe.

```c
token_val = token_val * 16 + (token & 0x0F) + (token >= 'A' ? 9 : 0);
```

In case you are not familiar with this "small trick", `a`'s hex value is `61`
in ASCII while `A` is `41`. Thus `token & 0x0F` can get the the smallest digit
out of the character.

```c
void next() {
        ...



        else if (token >= '0' && token <= '9') {
            // parse number, three kinds: dec(123) hex(0x123) oct(017)
            token_val = token - '0';
            if (token_val > 0) {
                // dec, starts with [1-9]
                while (*src >= '0' && *src <= '9') {
                    token_val = token_val*10 + *src++ - '0';
                }
            } else {
                // starts with number 0
                if (*src == 'x' || *src == 'X') {
                    //hex
                    token = *++src;
                    while ((token >= '0' && token <= '9') || (token >= 'a' && token <= 'f') || (token >= 'A' && token <= 'F')) {
                        token_val = token_val * 16 + (token & 15) + (token >= 'A' ? 9 : 0);
                        token = *++src;
                    }
                } else {
                    // oct
                    while (*src >= '0' && *src <= '7') {
                        token_val = token_val*8 + *src++ - '0';
                    }
                }
            }
            token = Num;
            return;
        }


        ...
}
```


## String Literals

If we encounter a string literal, we need to store it into the `data segment`
that we introduced in a previous chapter, and return its address. Another issue
we need to care about are escaped characters, e.g. `\n` to represent a newline
character. But we won't support escaped characters other than `\n` (like `\t`
or `\r`) because we're aiming at bootstrapping only. Note that we still support
the syntax where `\x` represent the `x` character itself.

Our lexer will analyze a single character (e.g. `'a'`) at the same time. Once a
character is found, we return it as a `Num`.

```c
void next() {
        ...

        else if (token == '"' || token == '\'') {
            // parse string literal, currently, the only supported escape
            // character is '\n', store the string literal into data.
            last_pos = data;
            while (*src != 0 && *src != token) {
                token_val = *src++;
                if (token_val == '\\') {
                    // escape character
                    token_val = *src++;
                    if (token_val == 'n') {
                        token_val = '\n';
                    }
                }
                if (token == '"') {
                    *data++ = token_val;
                }
            }

            src++;
            // if it is a single character, return Num token
            if (token == '"') {
                token_val = (int)last_pos;
            } else {
                token = Num;
            }

            return;
        }
}
```

## Comments

Only C++ style comments (e.g. `// comment`) are supported.
C style comments (`/* ... */`) are not supported.

```c
void next() {
        ...

        else if (token == '/') {
            if (*src == '/') {
                // skip comments
                while (*src != 0 && *src != '\n') {
                    ++src;
                }
            } else {
                // divide operator
                token = Div;
                return;
            }
        }

        ...
}
```

Now we'll introduce a new concept: `lookahead`. In the above code we see that
for source code starting with character `/`, either 'comment' or `/(Div)` may
be encountered.

Sometimes we cannot decide which token to generate by only looking at the
current character (such as the above example about divide and comment), thus we
need to check the next character (called `lookahead`) in order to determine. In
our example, if it is another slash `/`, then we've encountered a comment line,
otherwise it is a divide operator.

Like we've said that a lexer and a parser are inherently a kind of compiler,
`lookahead` also exists in parsers. However parsers will look ahead for "token"
instead of "character". The `k` in `LL(k)` of compiler theory is the amount of
tokens a parser needs to look ahead.

Also, if we don't split the compiler into a lexer and a parser, the compiler
will have to look ahead a lot of characters to decide what to do next. So we
can say that a lexer reduces the amount of lookahead a compiler needs to check.


## Other Tokens

The remaining tokes are simpler and straightforward, check the code:

```c
void next() {
        ...
        else if (token == '=') {
            // parse '==' and '='
            if (*src == '=') {
                src ++;
                token = Eq;
            } else {
                token = Assign;
            }
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '+') {
            // parse '+' and '++'
            if (*src == '+') {
                src ++;
                token = Inc;
            } else {
                token = Add;
            }
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '-') {
            // parse '-' and '--'
            if (*src == '-') {
                src ++;
                token = Dec;
            } else {
                token = Sub;
            }
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '!') {
            // parse '!='
            if (*src == '=') {
                src++;
                token = Ne;
            }
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '<') {
            // parse '<=', '<<' or '<'
            if (*src == '=') {
                src ++;
                token = Le;
            } else if (*src == '<') {
                src ++;
                token = Shl;
            } else {
                token = Lt;
            }
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '>') {
            // parse '>=', '>>' or '>'
            if (*src == '=') {
                src ++;
                token = Ge;
            } else if (*src == '>') {
                src ++;
                token = Shr;
            } else {
                token = Gt;
            }
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '|') {
            // parse '|' or '||'
            if (*src == '|') {
                src ++;
                token = Lor;
            } else {
                token = Or;
            }
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '&') {
            // parse '&' and '&&'
            if (*src == '&') {
                src ++;
                token = Lan;
            } else {
                token = And;
            }
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '^') {
            token = Xor;
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '%') {
            token = Mod;
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '*') {
            token = Mul;
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '[') {
            token = Brak;
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '?') {
            token = Cond;
            return;
        }
        else if (token == '~' || token == ';' || token == '{' || token == '}' || token == '(' || token == ')' || token == ']' || token == ',' || token == ':') {
            // directly return the character as token;
            return;
        }

        ...
}
```

## Keywords and Built-in Functions

Keywords such as `if`, `while` or `return` are special because they are known
by the compiler in advance. We cannot treat them like normal identifiers
because they have special meanings. There are two ways to deal with it:

1. Let lexer parse them and return a token to identify them.
2. Treat them as normal identifier but store them into the symbol table in
   advance.

We choose the second path: add corresponding identifiers into the symbol table
in advance and set the needed properties (e.g. the `Token` type we mentioned).
So, when keywords are encountered in the source code, they will be interpreted
as identifiers, but since they already exist in the symbol table we can know
that they are different from normal identifiers.

Built-in function are similar. They are only different in their internal
information. In the main function, add the following:

```c
// types of variable/function
enum { CHAR, INT, PTR };
int *idmain;                  // the `main` function
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    ...

    src = "char else enum if int return sizeof while "
          "open read close printf malloc memset memcmp exit void main";


    // add keywords to symbol table
    i = Char;
    while (i <= While) {
        next();
        current_id[Token] = i++;
    }

    // add library to symbol table
    i = OPEN;
    while (i <= EXIT) {
        next();
        current_id[Class] = Sys;
        current_id[Type] = INT;
        current_id[Value] = i++;
    }

    next(); current_id[Token] = Char; // handle void type
    next(); idmain = current_id; // keep track of main

    ...
    program();
    return eval();
}
```


## Source Code

You can check out the code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter/tree/step-2),
or clone with:

```
git clone -b step-2 https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter
```

Executing the code will raise a 'Segmentation Fault' because it will try to
execute the virtual machine that we've build in the previous chapter, which
won't work because it doesn't contain any runnable code.


## Summary

1. Lexer is used to pre-process the source code, in order to reduce the
   complexity of the parser.
2. Lexer is also a kind of compiler which consumes source code and outputs
   a token stream.
3. `lookahead(k)` is used to fully determine the meaning of the current
   character/token.
4. How to represent identifiers and the symbol table.

We will discuss about top-down recursive parser. See you then. :smile:
