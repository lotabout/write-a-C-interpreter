In this chapter, we are going to build a virtual machine and design our own
instruction set that runs on the VM. This VM will be the target platform of
the interpreter's code generation phase.

If you've heard of JVM and bytecode, that's what we are trying to build, but a
way way simpler one.

## How computer works internally

There are three components we need to care about: CPU, registers and memory.
Code(or assembly instruction) are stored in the memory as binary data; CPU
will retrieve the instruction one by one and execute them; the running states
of the machine is stored in registers.

### Memory

Memory can be used to store data. By data I mean code(or called assembly
instructions) or other data such as the message you want to print out. All of
them are stored as binary.

Modern operating system introduced *Virtual Memory* which maps memory
addresses used by a program called *virtual address* into physical addresses
in computer memory. It can hide the physical details of memory from the
program.

The benefit of virtual memory is that it can hide the details of a physical
memory from the programs. For example, in 32bit machine, all the available
memory address is `2^32 = 4G` while the actaul physical memory may be only
`256M`. The program will still think that it can have `4G` memory to use, the
OS will map them to physical ones.

Of course, you don't need to understand the details about that. But what you
should understand that a program's usable memory is partioned into several
segments:

1. `text` segment: for storing code(instructions).
2. `data` segment: for storing initialized data. For example `int i = 10;`
   will need to utilize this segment.
3. `bss` segment: for storing un-initialized data. For example `int i[1000];`
   does't need to occupy `1000*4` bytes, because the actual values in the
   array don't matter, thus we can store them in `bss` to save some space.
4. `stack` segment: used to handling the states of function calls, such as
   calling frames and local variables of a function.
5. `heap` segment: use to allocate memory dynamically for program.

An example of the layout of these segments here:

```
+------------------+
|    stack   |     |      high address
|    ...     v     |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|                  |
|    ...     ^     |
|    heap    |     |
+------------------+
| bss  segment     |
+------------------+
| data segment     |
+------------------+
| text segment     |      low address
+------------------+
```

Our virtual machine tends to be as simple as possible, thus we don't care
about the `bss` and `heap`. Our interperter don't support the initialization
of data, thus we'll merge the `data` and `bss` segment. More over, we only use
`data` segment for storing string literals.

We'll drop `heap` as well. This might sounds insane because theoretically the
VM should maintain a `heap` for allocation memories. But hey, an interpreter
itself is also a program which had its heap allocated by our computer. We can
tell the program that we want to interpret to utilize the interpreter's heap
by introducing an instruction `MSET`. I won't say it is cheating because it
readuces the VM's complexity without reducing the knowledge we want to learn
about compiler.

Thus we adds the following codes in the global area:

```c
int *text,            // text segment
    *old_text,        // for dump text segment
    *stack;           // stack
char *data;           // data segment
```

Note the `int` here. What we should write is actually `unsigned` because we'll
store unsigned data(such as pointers/memory address) in the `text` segment.
Note we want our interpreter to be bootstraping (interpret itself), thus we
don't want to introduce `unsigned`. Finally the `data` is `char *` because
we'll use it to store string literals only.

Finally, add the code in the main function to actually allocate the segments:

```c
int main() {
    close(fd);
    ...

    // allocate memory for virtual machine
    if (!(text = old_text = malloc(poolsize))) {
        printf("could not malloc(%d) for text area\n", poolsize);
        return -1;
    }
    if (!(data = malloc(poolsize))) {
        printf("could not malloc(%d) for data area\n", poolsize);
        return -1;
    }
    if (!(stack = malloc(poolsize))) {
        printf("could not malloc(%d) for stack area\n", poolsize);
        return -1;
    }

    memset(text, 0, poolsize);
    memset(data, 0, poolsize);
    memset(stack, 0, poolsize);

    ...
    program();
}
```

### Registers

Registers are used to store the running states of computers. There are several
of them in real computers while our VM uses only 4:

1. `PC`: program counter, it stores an memory address in which stores the
   **next** instruction to be run.
2. `SP`: stack pointer, which always points to the *top* of the stack. Notice
   the stack grows from high address to low address so that when we push a new
   element to the stack, `SP` decreases.
3. `BP`: base pointer, points to some elements on the stack. It is used in
   function calls.
4. `AX`: a general register that we used to store the result of an
   instruction.

In order to fully understand why we need these registers, you need to
understand what states will a computer need to store during computation. They
are just a place to store value. You will get a better understanding after
finished this chapter.

Well, add some code into the global area:

```c
int *pc, *bp, *sp, ax, cycle; // virtual machine registers
```

And add the initialization code in the `main` function. Note that `pc` should
points to the `main` function of the program to be interpreted. But we don't
have any code generation yet, thus skip for now.

```c
    memset(stack, 0, poolsize);
    ...

    bp = sp = stack + poolsize/sizeof(int);
    ax = 0;

    ...
    program();
```

What's left is the CPU part, what we should actually do is implementing the
instruction sets. We'll save that for a new section.

## Instruction Set

Instruction set is a set of instruction that CPU can understand, it is the
language we need to master in order to talk to CPU. We are going to design a
language for our VM, it is based on x86 instruction set yet much simpler.

We'll start by adding an `enum` type listing all the instructions that our VM
would understand:

```c
// instructions
enum { LEA ,IMM ,JMP ,CALL,JZ  ,JNZ ,ENT ,ADJ ,LEV ,LI  ,LC  ,SI  ,SC  ,PUSH,
       OR  ,XOR ,AND ,EQ  ,NE  ,LT  ,GT  ,LE  ,GE  ,SHL ,SHR ,ADD ,SUB ,MUL ,DIV ,MOD ,
       OPEN,READ,CLOS,PRTF,MALC,MSET,MCMP,EXIT };
```

These instruction are ordered intentionally as you will find out later that
instructions with arguments comes first while those without arguments comes
after. The only benefit here is for printing debug info. However we will not
rely on this order to introduce them.

### MOV

`MOV` is one of the most fundamental instructions you'll met. Its job is to
move data into registers or the memory, kind of like the assignment expression
in C. There are two arguments in `x86`'s `MOV` instruction: `MOV dest,
source`(Intel style), `source` can be a number, a register or a memory
address.

But we won't follow `x86`. On one hand our VM has only one general
register(`AX`), on the other hand it is difficult to determine the type of the
arguments(wheter it is number, register or adddress). Thus we tear `MOV` apart
into 5 pieces:

1. `IMM <num>` to put immediate `<num>` into register `AX`.
2. `LC` to load a character into `AX` from a memory address which is stored in
   `AX` before execution.
3. `LI` just like `LC` but dealing with integer instead of character.
4. `SC` to store the character in `AX` into the memory whose address is stored
   on the top of the stack.
5. `SI` just like `SC` but dealing with integer instead of character.

What? I want one `MOV`, not 5 instruction just to replace it! Don't panic!
You should know that `MOV` is actually a set of instruction that depends on
the `type` of its arguments, so you got `MOVB` for bytes and `MOVW` for words,
etc. Now `LC/SC` and `LI/SI` don't seems that bad, uha?

Well the most important reason is that by turning `MOV` into 5 sub
instructions, we reduce the complexity a lot! Only `IMM` will accept an
argument now yet no need to worry about its type.

Let's implement it in the `eval` function:

```c
void eval() {
    int op, *tmp;
    while (1) {
        if (op == IMM)       {ax = *pc++;}                                     // load immediate value to ax
        else if (op == LC)   {ax = *(char *)ax;}                               // load character to ax, address in ax
        else if (op == LI)   {ax = *(int *)ax;}                                // load integer to ax, address in ax
        else if (op == SC)   {ax = *(char *)*sp++ = ax;}                       // save character to address, value in ax, address on stack
        else if (op == SI)   {*(int *)*sp++ = ax;}                             // save integer to address, value in ax, address on stack
    }

    ...
    return 0;
}
```

`*sp++` is used to `POP` out one stack element.

You might wonder why we store the address in `AX` register for `LI/LC` while
storing them on top of the stack segment for `SI/SC`. The reason is that the
result of an instruction is stored in `AX` by default. The memory address is also
calculate by an instruction, thus it is more convenient for `LI/LC` to fetch
it directly from `AX`. Also `PUSH` can only push the value of `AX` onto the
stack. So if we want to put an address onto the stack, we'll have to store it
in `AX` anyway, why not skip that?

### PUSH

`PUSH` in `x86` can push an immediate value or a register's value onto the
stack. Here in our VM, `PUSH` will push the value in `AX` onto the stack,
only.

```c
else if (op == PUSH) {*--sp = ax;}                                     // push the value of ax onto the stack
```

### JMP

`JMP <addr>` will unconditionally set the value `PC` register to `<addr>`.

```c
else if (op == JMP)  {pc = (int *)*pc;}                                // jump to the address
```

Notice that `PC` points to the **NEXT** instruction to be executed. Thus `*pc`
stores the argument of `JMP` instruction, i.e. the `<addr>`.

### JZ/JNZ

We'll need conditional jump so as to implement `if` statement. Only two
are needed here to jump when `AX` is `0` or not.

```c
else if (op == JZ)   {pc = ax ? pc + 1 : (int *)*pc;}                   // jump if ax is zero
else if (op == JNZ)  {pc = ax ? (int *)*pc : pc + 1;}                   // jump if ax is not zero
```

### Function Call

It will introduce the calling frame which is hard to understand, so we put it
together to give you an overview. We'll add `CALL`, `ENT`, `ADJ` and `LEV` in
order to support function calls.

A function is a block of code, it may be physically far form the instruction
we are currently executing. So we'll need to `JMP` to the starting point of a
function. Then why introduce a new instruction `CALL`? Because we'll need to
do some bookkeeping: store the current execution position so that the program
can resume after function call returns.

So we'll need `CALL <addr>` to call the function whose starting point is
`<addr>` and `RET` to fetch the bookkeeping information to resume previous
execution.

```c
else if (op == CALL) {*--sp = (int)(pc+1); pc = (int *)*pc;}           // call subroutine
//else if (op == RET)  {pc = (int *)*sp++;}                              // return from subroutine;
```

We've commented out `RET` because we'll replace it with `LEV` later.

In practice the compiler should deal with more: how to pass the arguments to
a function? How to return the data from the function?

Our convention here about returning value is to store it into `AX` no mater
you're returning a value or a memory address. Then how about argument?

Different language has different convension, here is the standard for C:

1. It is the caller's duty to push the arguments onto stack.
2. After the function call returns, caller need to pop out the arguments.
3. The arguments are pushed in the reversed order.

Note that we won't follow rule 3. Now let's check how C standard works(from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions)):

```c
int callee(int, int, int);

int caller(void)
{
	int i, ret;

	ret = callee(1, 2, 3);
	ret += 5;
	return ret;
}
```

The compiler will generate the following assembly instructions:

```
caller:
	; make new call frame
	push    ebp
	mov     ebp, esp
        sub     1, esp       ; save stack for variable: i
	; push call arguments
	push    3
	push    2
	push    1
	; call subroutine 'callee'
	call    callee
	; remove arguments from frame
	add     esp, 12
	; use subroutine result
	add     eax, 5
	; restore old call frame
        mov     esp, ebp
	pop     ebp
	; return
	ret
```

The above assembly instructions cannot be achieved in our VM due to several
reasons:

1. `push ebp`, while our `PUSH` doesn't accept arguments at all.
2. `move ebp, esp`, our `MOV` instruction cannot do this.
3. `add esp, 12`, well, still cannot do this(as you'll find out later).

Our instruction set is too simply that we cannot not support function calls!
But we will not surrender to change our design cause it will be too complex
for us. So we add more instructions! It might cost a lot in real computers to
add a new instruction, but not for virtual machine.

### ENT

`ENT <size>` is called when we are about to enter the function call to "make a
new calling frame". It will store the current `PC` value onto the stack, and
save some space(`<size>` bytes) to store the local variables for function.

```
; make new call frame
push    ebp
mov     ebp, esp
sub     1, esp       ; save stack for variable: i
```

Will be translated into:

```c
else if (op == ENT)  {*--sp = (int)bp; bp = sp; sp = sp - *pc++;}      // make new stack frame
```

### ADJ

`ADJ <size>` is to adjust the stack, to "remove arguments from frame". We need
this instruction mainly because our `ADD` don't have enough power. So, treat
it as a special add instruction.

```
; remove arguments from frame
add     esp, 12
```

Is implemented as:

```c
else if (op == ADJ)  {sp = sp + *pc++;}                                // add esp, <size>
```

### LEV

In case you don't notice, our instruction set don't have `POP`. `POP` in our
compiler would only be used when function call returns. Which is like this:

```
; restore old call frame
mov     esp, ebp
pop     ebp
; return
ret
```

Thus we'll make another instruction `LEV` to accomplish the work of `MOV`,
`POP` and `RET`:

```c
else if (op == LEV)  {sp = bp; bp = (int *)*sp++; pc = (int *)*sp++;}  // restore call frame and PC
```

### LEA

The instructions introduced above try to solve the problem of
creating/destructing calling frames, one thing left here is how to fetch the
arguments *inside* sub function.

But we'll check out what a calling frame looks like before learning how to
fetch arguments (Note that arguments are pushed in its calling order):

```
sub_function(arg1, arg2, arg3);

|    ....       | high address
+---------------+
| arg: 1        |    new_bp + 4
+---------------+
| arg: 2        |    new_bp + 3
+---------------+
| arg: 3        |    new_bp + 2
+---------------+
|return address |    new_bp + 1
+---------------+
| old BP        | <- new BP
+---------------+
| local var 1   |    new_bp - 1
+---------------+
| local var 2   |    new_bp - 2
+---------------+
|    ....       |  low address
```

So if we need to refer to `arg1`, we need to fetch `new_bp + 4`, which however
cannot be achieved by our poor `ADD` instruction. Thus we will make yet
another special `ADD` to do this: `LEA <offset>`.

```c
else if (op == LEA)  {ax = (int)(bp + *pc++);}                         // load address for arguments.
```

Together with the instructions above, we are able to make function calls.

### Mathmetical Instructions

Our VM will provide an instruction for each operators in C language. Each
operator has two arguments: the first one is stored on the top of the stack
while the second is stored in `AX`. The order matters especially in operators
like `-`, `/`. After the calculation is done, the argument on the stack will
be poped out and the result will be stored in `AX`. So you are not able to
fetch the first argument from the stack after the calculation, please note
that.

```c
else if (op == OR)  ax = *sp++ | ax;
else if (op == XOR) ax = *sp++ ^ ax;
else if (op == AND) ax = *sp++ & ax;
else if (op == EQ)  ax = *sp++ == ax;
else if (op == NE)  ax = *sp++ != ax;
else if (op == LT)  ax = *sp++ < ax;
else if (op == LE)  ax = *sp++ <= ax;
else if (op == GT)  ax = *sp++ >  ax;
else if (op == GE)  ax = *sp++ >= ax;
else if (op == SHL) ax = *sp++ << ax;
else if (op == SHR) ax = *sp++ >> ax;
else if (op == ADD) ax = *sp++ + ax;
else if (op == SUB) ax = *sp++ - ax;
else if (op == MUL) ax = *sp++ * ax;
else if (op == DIV) ax = *sp++ / ax;
else if (op == MOD) ax = *sp++ % ax;
```

### Built-in Instructions

Besides core logic, a program will need input/output mechanism to be
able to interact with. `printf` in C is one of the commonly used output
functions. `printf` is very complex to implement but unavoidable if our
compiler wants to be bootstraping(interpret itself) yet it is meaningless for
building a compiler.

Our plan is to create new instructions to build a bridge between the
interpreted program and the interpreter itself. So that we can utilize the
libraries of the host system(your computer that runs the interpreter).

We'll need `exit`, `open`, `close`, `read`, `printf`, `malloc`, `memset` and `memcmp`:

```c
else if (op == EXIT) { printf("exit(%d)", *sp); return *sp;}
else if (op == OPEN) { ax = open((char *)sp[1], sp[0]); }
else if (op == CLOS) { ax = close(*sp);}
else if (op == READ) { ax = read(sp[2], (char *)sp[1], *sp); }
else if (op == PRTF) { tmp = sp + pc[1]; ax = printf((char *)tmp[-1], tmp[-2], tmp[-3], tmp[-4], tmp[-5], tmp[-6]); }
else if (op == MALC) { ax = (int)malloc(*sp);}
else if (op == MSET) { ax = (int)memset((char *)sp[2], sp[1], *sp);}
else if (op == MCMP) { ax = memcmp((char *)sp[2], (char *)sp[1], *sp);}
```

At last, add some error handling:

```c
else {
    printf("unknown instruction:%d\n", op);
    return -1;
}
```

## Test

Now we'll do some "assembly programing" to calculate `10 + 20`:

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    ax = 0;
    ...
    i = 0;
    text[i++] = IMM;
    text[i++] = 10;
    text[i++] = PUSH;
    text[i++] = IMM;
    text[i++] = 20;
    text[i++] = ADD;
    text[i++] = PUSH;
    text[i++] = EXIT;
    pc = text;
    ...
    program();
}
```

Compile the interpreter with `gcc xc-tutor.c` and run it with `./a.out
hello.c`, got the following result:

```
exit(30)
```

Note that we specified `hello.c` but it is actually not used, we need it
because the interpreter we build in last chapter needs it.

Well, it seems that our VM works well :)

## Summary

We learned how computer works internally and build our own instruction set
modeled after `x86` assembly instructions. We are actually trying to learn
assembly language and how it actually work by building our own version.


The code for this chapter can be downloaded from
[Github](https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter/tree/step-1), or
clone by:

```
git clone -b step-1 https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter
```

Note that adding a new instruction would require designing lots of circuits
and cost a lot. But it is almost free to add new instructions in our virtual
machine. We are taking advantage of this spliting the functions of an
intruction into several to simplify the implementation.

If you are interested, build your own instruction sets!
